    Hi there! I am a first-year student of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mcs.ics.uci.edu/">Master of Computer Science</a> at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a>. Before that, I studied software engineering at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.nenu.edu.cn/">Northeast Normal University</a> from 2017 to 2021. After graduation, I joined <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/meituan/">Meituan</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/3690:HKG">HKG: 3690</a>) as a backend development engineer in 2021, where I gained a wealth of knowledge and had an incredibly rewarding and enjoyable experience. </br> 
    One of the most exceptional projects I worked on at Meituan was the development of a marketing system based on WeCom. This system enabled the delivery of promotional content through multiple channels such as group chats, private messages, and posts, significantly boosting user engagement and product exposure. As part of the core team, I contributed to launching numerous features, helping scale the system to support a dramatic increase in business traffic, with unique visitors growing from 1M to 6M.</br>
    This project played a key role in driving substantial business growth and operational efficiency. My contributions were recognized with a <strong>first-place</strong> ranking among junior employees, earning me the title of <strong>Most Outstanding Junior Employee in the Business Group</strong>, an honor that reflects my ability to deliver results and continuously strive for excellence.</br>
    Outside of studying and working, I enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles (<strong>my absolute favorite!</strong>), watching dramas and movies, writing in my diary, and traveling to unwind and relax.</br>
